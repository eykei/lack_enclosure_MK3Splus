# Summary

I noticed that the new Prusa i3 MKS3 Delta Black PSU doesn't seem to fit using the original Ikea Lack enclosure plans, so I popped over to thingiverse to see if anybody else made updated brackets. Luckily, azaletel created a [good substitute](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3553216 "Bottom Bracket") for the bottom bracket, but I wasn't too keen on drilling through the deck of my table to pass the cables through. So I designed a new top bracket.

It was my first foray into Fusion 360, and I'm fairly pleased at how it turned out.

Hardware Used:

M3 screws and nuts from the Prusa Kit
Pan Philips #8 x 3/4 Inch Metal Screw for attaching to the Ikea Table Legs

A couple of issues:

I did make longer cables, I'm not sure if this design will work with the power cables that are supplied from Prusa because they aren't very long.

The little hole for the power panic might be a bit forward, and could be pinched by the black Prusa bracket.

The PRUSA text on the supplied cable guide is upside down, I might get around to flipping the text one day.
Update: Refer to https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3664822 for an updated cable guide by Sixteenbit.

Special thanks to my Dad, who gave some input into the design.
