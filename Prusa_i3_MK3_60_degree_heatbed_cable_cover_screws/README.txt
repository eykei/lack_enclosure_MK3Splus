# Summary

Prusa i3 MK3 heatbed cable cover for the heatbed version with screws instead of soldered cables.
Adapted from the [soldered cable version by OakMountain](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2890592). 

Changes:
+ Added holes for the protruding screws & nuts.
+ One of the walls is thinner to make space for the more rigid cables.

The cables are a very tight fit, but with some effort they'll fit.

Bolt it down too hard and the nuts will show up as bulges through the top, as happened to me.

Uses the same nuts and bolts as the original part:
+ M3x10 screw (3x)
+ M3n nut (3x)


The edited mesh looks a litte rough in a 3D but prints fine.
